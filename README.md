Configurable BoM generation tool for KiCad EDA (http://kicad.org/)

## Description

KiBoM is a configurable BOM (Bill of Materials) generation tool for KiCad EDA. Written in Python, it can be used directly with KiCad software without the need for any external libraries or plugins.

KiBoM intelligently groups components based on multiple factors, and can generate BoM files in multiple output formats.

BoM options are user-configurable in a per-project configuration file.

## Installation

KiBoM can be installed via multiple methods:

**A. Download**

Download the KiBoM [package from github](https://github.com/SchrodingersGat/KiBoM/archive/master.zip) and extract the .zip archive to a location on your computer.

**B. Git Clone**

Use git to clone the source code to your computer:

`git clone https://github.com/SchrodingersGat/kibom`

**C. PIP**

KiBom can also be installed through the PIP package manager:

```pip install kibom```

*Note: Take note of which python executable you use when installing kibom - this is the same executable you must use when running the KiBom script from KiCAD (more details below under "Usage")*

Installing under PIP is recommended for advanced users only, as the exact location of the installed module must be known to properly run the script from within KiCad.

## Usage

The *KiBOM_CLI* script can be run directly from KiCad or from the command line. For command help, run the script with the *-h* flag e.g.

`python KiBOM_CLI.py -h`

~~~~                        

**netlist** The netlist must be provided to the script. When running from KiCad use "%I"

**output** This is the path to the BoM output. When running from KiCad, usage "%O" for the default option

* If a suffix is not specified, CSV output format will be used
* HTML output can be specified within KiCad as: "%O.html" or "%O_BOM.html" (etc)
* XML output can be specified within KiCad as: "%O.xml" (etc)
* XSLX output can be specified within KiCad as: "%O.xlsx" (etc)

**-n --number** Specify number of boards for calculating part quantities

**-v --verbose** Enable extra debugging information

**-r --variant** Specify the PCB *variant(s)*. Support for arbitrary PCB variants allows individual components to be marked as 'fitted' or 'not fitted' in a given variant. You can provide muliple variants comma-separated. You can generate multiple BoMs at once for different variants by using semicolon-separation.

**-d --subdirectory** Specify a subdirectory (from the provided **output** file) into which the boms should be generated.

**--cfg** If provided, this is the BoM config file that will be used. If not provided, options will be loaded from "bom.ini"

**-s --separator** Override the delimiter for CSV or TSV generation

**-k --no-colon-sep** Only accept `=` as a delimiter for KEY/VALUE pairs in the config file, enables the use of `:` in field names

--------
To run from KiCad, simply add the same command line in the *Bill of Materials* script window. e.g. to generate a HTML output:

![alt tag](example/html_ex.png?raw=True "HTML Example")

## Quick Start

Download and unzip the files almost anywhere.  

When you start the KiCad schematic editor and choose *Tools>Generate Bill of Materials* expect a *Bill of Material* dialog.  Choose the *Add Plugin* button, expect a file chooser dialog.  Navigate to where you unzipped the files, select the KiBOM_CLI.py file, and choose the *Open* button.  Expect another confirmation dialog and choose *OK*.  Expect the *Command Line:* text box to be filled in, and for a description of the plugin to appear in the *Plugin Info* text box.  Choose the *Generate* button.  Expect some messages in the *Plugin Info* text box, and for a .csv file to exist in your KiCad project directory.

If you want other than .csv format, edit the *Command Line*, for example inserting ".html" after the "%O".

If you want more columns in your BoM, before you generate your BoM, in the schematic editor choose *Preferences>Schematic Editor Options*  and create new rows in the *Template Field Names* tab.  Then edit your components and fill in the fields.  KiBoM will reasonably sum rows in the BoM having the same values in your fields.  For example, if you have two components both with Vendor=Digikey and SKU=877-5309 (and value and footprints equal), there will be one row with Quantity "2" and References e.g. "R1, R2."

## Features

### Intelligent Component Grouping

To be useful for ordering components, the BoM output from a KiCad project should be organized into sensible component groups. By default, KiBoM groups components based on the following factors:

* Part name: (e.g. 'R' for resistors, 'C' for capacitors, or longer part names such as 'MAX232') *note: parts such as {'R','r_small'} (which are different symbol representations for the same component) can also be grouped together*
* Value: Components must have the same value to be grouped together
* Footprint: Components must have the same footprint to be grouped together *(this option can be enabled/disabled in the bom.ini configuration file)*

#### Custom Column Grouping

If the user wishes to group components based on additional field values, these can be specified in the preferences (.ini) file

### Intelligent Value Matching

Some component values can be expressed in multiple ways (e.g. "0.1uF" === "100n" for a capacitor). KiBoM matches value strings based on their interpreted numerical value, such that components are grouped together even if their values are expressed differently.

### Field Extraction

In addition to the default KiCad fields which are assigned to each component, KiBoM extracts and custom fields added to the various components.

**Default Fields**

The following default fields are extracted and can be added to the output BoM file:
* `Description` : Part description as per the schematic symbol
* `References` : List of part references included in a particular group
* `Quantity` : Number of components included in a particular group
* `Part` : Part name as per the schematic symbol
* `Part Lib` : Part library for the symbol *(default - not output to BoM file)*
* `Footprint` : Part footprint
* `Footprint Lib` : Part footprint library *(default - not output to BoM file)*
* `Datasheet` : Component datasheet extracted either from user-included data, or from part library

**User Fields**

If any components have custom fields added, these are available to the output BoM file.

**Joining Fields**

The user may wish to have separate fields in the output BOM file. For example, multiple component parameters such as [Voltage / Current / Tolerance] could be joined into the *Value* field in the generated BOM file.

Field joining is configured in the `bom.ini` file. Under the `[JOIN]` section in the file, multiple join entries can be specified by the user to be joined. Each line is a separate entry, which contains two or more tab-separated field names.

The first name specifies the primary field which be displayed in the output file. The following names specifiy fields which will be joined into the primary field.

Example:

```
[JOIN]
Value    Voltage  Current  Tolerance
```

This entry will append the `voltage`, `current` and `tolerance` values into the `value` field.

### Multiple PCB Configurations

KiBoM allows for arbitrary PCB configurations, which means that the user can specify that individual components will be included or excluded from the BoM in certain circumstances.

The preferences (.ini) file provides the *fit_field* option which designates a particular part field (default = "Config") which the user can specify whether or not a part is to be included.

**DNF Parts**

To specify a part as DNF (do not fit), the *fit_field* field can be set to one of the following values: (case insensitive)

* "dnf"
* "do not fit"
* "nofit"
* "not fitted"
* "dnp"
* "do not place"
* "no stuff"
* "nostuff"
* "noload"
* "do not load"

**DNC Parts**

Parts can be marked as *do not change* or *fixed* by specifying the `dnc` attribute in the *fit_field* field.

**Note:**

If the *Value* field for the component contains any of these values, the component will also not be included

**PCB Variants**

To generate a BoM with a custom *Variant*, the --variant flag can be used at the command line to specify which variant is to be used.

If a variant is specified, the value of the *fit_field* field is used to determine if a component will be included in the BoM, as follows:

* If the *fit_field* value is empty / blank then it will be loaded in ALL variants.
* If the *fit_field* begins with a '-' character, if will be excluded from the matching variant.
* If the *fit_field* begins with a '+' character, if will ONLY be included in the matching variant.

Multiple variants can be addressed as the *fit_field* can contain multiple comma-separated values. Multiple BoMs can be generated at once by using semicolon-separated values.

* If you specify multiple variants
   - If the *fit_field* contains the variant beginning with a '-' character, it will be excluded irrespective of any other '+' matches.
   - If the *fit_field* contains the variant beginning with a '+' and matches any of the given variants, it will be included.

e.g. if we have a PCB with three components that have the following values in the *fit_field* field:

* C1 -> "-production,+test"
* C2 -> "+production,+test"
* R1 -> ""
* R2 -> "-test"

If the script is run with the flag *--variant production* then C2, R1 and R2 will be loaded.

If the script is run without the *--variant production* flag, then R1 and R2 will be loaded.

If the script is run with the flag *--variant test*, then C1, C2 and R1 will be loaded.

If the script is run with the flags *--variant production,test*, then C2 and R1 will be loaded.

If the script is run with the flags *--variant production;test;production,test*, then three separate BoMs will be generated one as though it had been run with *--variant production*, one for *--variant test*, and one for *--variant production,test*.

### Regular Expression Matching

KiBoM features two types of regex matching : "Include" and "Exclude" (each of these are specified within the preferences (bom.ini) file).

If the user wishes to include ONLY parts that match one-of-many regular expressions, these can be specified in REGEX_INCLUDE section of the bom.ini file

If the user wishes to exclude components based on one-of-many regular expressions, these are specified in the REGEX_EXCLUDE section of the bom.ini file

(Refer to the default bom.ini file for examples)

### Multiple File Outputs
Multiple BoM output formats are supported:
* CSV (Comma separated values)
* TSV (Tab separated values)
* TXT (Text file output with tab separated values)
* XML
* HTML
* XLSX (Needs XlsxWriter Python module)

Output file format selection is set by the output filename. e.g. "bom.html" will be written to a HTML file, "bom.csv" will be written to a CSV file.

### Digi-Key Linking

If you have a field containing the Digi-Key part number you can make its column to contain links to the Digi-Key web page for this component. (*Note: Digi-Key links will only be generated for the HTML output format*).

**Instructions**

Specify a column (field) to use as the `digikey_link` field in the configuration file (ie. `bom.ini`). The value for this option is the column you want to convert into a link to the Digi-Key. Note that this field must contian a valid Digi-Key part number in each row. 

For example:

`digikey_link = digikeypn`

This will render entries in the column *digikeypn* as hyperlinks to the component webpage on the Digi-Key website.

**Limitations**

Note that Digi-Key URL rendering will only be rendered for HTML file outputs.

### Configuration File
BoM generation options can be configured (on a per-project basis) by editing the *bom.ini* file in the PCB project directory. This file is generated the first time that the KiBoM script is run, and allows configuration of the following options.
* `ignore_dnf` : Component groups designated as 'DNF' (do not fit) will be excluded from the BoM output
* `use_alt` : If this option is set, grouped references will be printed in the alternate compressed style eg: R1-R7,R18
* `number_rows` : Add row numbers to the BoM output
* `group_connectors` : If this option is set, connector comparison based on the 'Value' field is ignored. This allows multiple connectors which are named for their function (e.g. "Power", "ICP" etc) can be grouped together.
* `test_regex` : If this option is set, each component group row is test against a list of (user configurable) regular expressions. If any matches are found, that row is excluded from the output BoM file.
* `merge_blank_field` : If this option is set, blank fields are able to be merged with non-blank fields (and do not count as a 'conflict')
* `ref_separator` : This is the character used to separate reference designators in the output, when grouped. Defaults to " ".
* `fit_field` : This is the name of the part field used to determine if the component is fitted, or not.
* `complex_variant` : This enable a more complex processing of variant fields using the `VARIANT:FIELD` format for the name of symbol properties
* `output_file_name` : A string that allows arbitrary specification of the output file name with field replacements. Fields available:
    - `%O` : The base output file name (pulled from kicad, or specified on command line when calling script).
    - `%v` : version number.
    - `%V` : variant name, note that this will be ammended according to `variant_file_name_format`.
* `variant_file_name_format` : A string that defines the variant file format. This is a unique field as the variant is not always used/specified.
* `make_backup` : If this option is set, a backup of the bom created before generating the new one. The option is a string that allows arbitrary specification of the filename. See `output_file_name` for available fields.
* `number_boards` : Specifies the number of boards to produce, if none is specified on CLI with `-n`.
* `board_variant` : Specifies the name of the PCB variant, if none is specified on CLI with `-r`.
* `hide_headers` : If this option is set, the table/column headers and legends are suppressed in the output file.
* `hide_pcb_info` : If this option is set, PCB information (version, component count, etc) are suppressed in the output file.
* `IGNORE_COLUMNS` : A list of columns can be marked as 'ignore', and will not be output to the BoM file. By default, the *Part_Lib* and *Footprint_Lib* columns are ignored.
* `GROUP_FIELDS` : A list of component fields used to group components together.
* `COMPONENT_ALIASES` : A list of space-separated values which allows multiple schematic symbol visualisations to be consolidated.
* `REGEX_INCLUDE` : A list of regular expressions used to explicitly include components. If there are no regex here, all components pass this test. If there are regex here, then a component must match at least one of them to be included in the BoM.
* `REGEX_EXCLUDE` : If a component matches any of these regular expressions, it will *not* be included in the BoM. Important: the `REGEX_INCLUDE` section has more precedence.

## Example

A simple schematic is shown below. Here a number of resistors, capacitors, and one IC have been added to demonstrate the BoM output capability. Some of the components have custom fields added ('Vendor', 'Rating', 'Notes')

![alt tag](example/schem.png?raw=True "Schematic")

Here, a number of logical groups can be seen:

**R1 R2**
Resistors R1 and R2 have the same value (470 Ohm) even though the value is expressed differently.
Resistors R1 and R2 have the same footprint

**R3 R4**
Resistors R3 and R4 have the same value and the same footprint

**R5**
While R5 has the same value as R3 and R4, it is in a different footprint and thus cannot be placed in the same group.

**C1 C2**
C1 and C2 have the same value and footprint

**C3 C5**
C3 and C5 have the same value and footprint

**C4**
C4 has a different footprint to C3 and C5, and thus is grouped separately

### HTML Output
The output HTML file is generated as follows:
